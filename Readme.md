# IBM Data Science Capstone - SpaceX Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the project files for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project. In this project, we analyze the SpaceX dataset to gain insights into the launch history of SpaceX, explore patterns and relationships within the dataset, and create visualizations to better understand the data.

## Dataset

The SpaceX dataset used in this project contains information about every launch conducted by SpaceX from 2006 to 2021. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/spacex/spacex-missions) and was originally sourced from [SpaceX's official website](https://www.spacex.com/missions).

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to use data analysis and visualization techniques to better understand the SpaceX launch history and explore patterns and trends within the dataset. Some specific goals of the project include:

- Analyzing the frequency and success rate of SpaceX launches over time
- Exploring the relationship between launch success and various launch parameters, such as payload mass and mission type
- Creating visualizations to better understand the data and communicate our findings

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook, the following packages are required:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- plotly

These packages can be installed using `pip`, for example:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
